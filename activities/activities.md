# Optional activities

None of the following are needed for coursework 1, however depending on your design you may wish/need to use one or more of them.

1. Plotly Go
2. Multipage Dash apps (this activity is in week 3)
3. Adding a ML model to Dash

## Plotly Go

### Overview of `plotly.graph_objects`

You may need to change features of a visualisation that are not exposed in Express, in which case you would need to use
Plotly.py graph objects instead. The following is a brief overview of using graph objects.

For most, Express will be sufficient for the coursework, so you may skip this activity if you find it confusing to learn
too many ways to create charts.

There are 3 main concepts in Plotlyâ€™s philosophy:

1. Data
2. Layout
3. Figure

### Data

The Data object defines what we want to display in the chart (that is, the data). We define a collection of data and the
specifications to display them as a trace. A Data object can have many traces. Think of a line chart with two lines
representing two different categories: each line is a trace.

### Layout

The Layout object defines features that are not related to data (like title, axis titles, and so on). We can also use
the Layout to add annotations and shapes to the chart.

### Figure

The Figure object creates the final object to be plotted. It's an object that contains both data and layout.

### Example chart

In the following code you can see how the layout is updated

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/718417069ead87650b90472464c7565dc8c2cb1c/coffee-flavors.csv')

fig = go.Figure()

fig.add_trace(go.Sunburst(
    ids=df.ids,
    labels=df.labels,
    parents=df.parents,
    domain=dict(column=1),
    maxdepth=2,
    insidetextorientation='radial'
))

fig.update_layout(
    margin=dict(t=10, l=10, r=10, b=10)
)

fig.show()
```

The code in [/examples/go.py](/examples/go.py) creates the above plot using code
from [Plotly.](https://plotly.com/python/sunburst-charts/#controlling-text-orientation-inside-sunburst-sectors)

### Further information
